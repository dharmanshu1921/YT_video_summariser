       "\" in Generation 3 the odds of encountering a shiny Pokémon are 1 in 8,192 in the new generations of Pokémon you have access to something called a shiny charm which increases the odds of you actually being able to encounter a shiny Pokémon but you guys are Generation 3 Fanatics and love the watch me hunt for shinies in a game that do not offer anything to boost my odds without the conveniences of the Medusa method or a shiny charm all of this is going to come down to patience a lot of patience welcome to my third and final Pokémon fire red/ leaf G shiny only video probably the rules for this one are pretty simple I need to have a full team of six shiny Pokémon before entering the Elite 4 every Pokemon must be shiny obviously that means no non- shiny hm users I can't use any items in battle and I must play on set mode these videos take a very long time to make so if you guys do want to see more like this make sure to subscribe and without any further Ado let's get into it here we are once again back in Pokémon Fire Red last time I did this I chose bubbl sore and the time before for that I chose Squirtle so this time it's time for Charmander the downside to this is that Charmander is going to be a lot worse at early game compared to Squirtle and Bulbasaur resetting for Charmander was a very annoying task I was able to get around 10 to 11 resets a minute which honestly isn't too bad but it still took a very long time to do I was getting around 660 resets an hour roughly of course and after many many hours and almost 177,000 resets I end up getting my shiny charmander Charmander does look pretty cool but we all know its final evolution looks a lot cooler the rifle battle ends up going as good as you would expect and I end up winning solely because my Pokémon is shiny and his is not and we all know shiny Pokémon have better stats than non- shiny Pokémon I head to the Martin town get this item for Oak return it to Oak get a pokedex and then I'm off to Vermilion Forest Town City home of the rocket type gym leader Brock and to say this did not go well is an understatement I am at level 14 so I do know metal claw but the Onyx was just not having any of it and the only way I was able to win was the just Brute Force reset on this battle until I get the best possible RNG which eventually did happen I ended up getting an attack boost for a metal claw as Onyx missed a rock tomb and then my next metal claw was a critical hit so that went really well and after showing off our insane skill we get the first gin badge I could also run now at level 16 Charmander evolved into Charmeleon which follows the same exact color scheme as Charmander did after defeating a super nerd in Mal Moon I have to pick a fossil and I end up choosing the Helix Fossil it has also occurred to me that I'm not going to beat Misty with a charmeleon even if it was level 40 so I think it's time to find our next team member I tried to beat Misty with only Charmeleon and I just do not think that it's possible so for my next team member I end up going west of Cillian this is Route four and honestly our options are not great here the options for this route are Rattata speo ekins and Mankey I could have different options if I go north but I do not want to overlevel using this method I'm able to encounter more Pokémon per hour compared to resetting for my starter this is mainly because there's no dialogue to get through and it doesn't ask me to name my starter every 2 seconds luckily for me this did not take as long as it did to get my starter it still took a couple weeks on and off but eventually I did run into my next team member our next team member is ankin at level six which definitely isn't the best but it will be helpful for Misty since eventually it does learn bite and star me of course is a psychic type but now that we got our second team member I could give it the most most creative nickname I could think of and we can continue once again the gym fight was not easy at all our starter is basically useless here so I have to completely rely on ekins the only upside is the fact that I have glare and bite which can be good for parap flinching but of course I have to get lucky for that to even be remotely a possibility and when snake got knocked out I couldn't even rely on smoke screen because star me had Swift and even though it's not super effective it was more than enough to take me out but eventually just like hunting for shinies if you reset enough you you will get lucky this battle specifically highlights how broken a parap Flinch combo was in Generation 3 I end up using glare on Staryu and taking it out with a critical bite and of course last up is the star me where I barely survive an attack with only 3 HP paralyze star me and then just Spam by and for some reason it ends up working out pretty well and now with Misty out of the way we get the Cascade badge and we can make our way to Bill Bill's a Clefairy so I unfairy him he gives me a ticket and bada bing bada boom I am in the next town city thing I soon arrive at the SSN where I could get the HM for cut which I am not teaching my Charmeleon and even though snake evolved into bigger snake it can not learn cut either the Rival Battle on the SSN is not even worth talking about as I just parap flinched literally everything and even though I get the HM cut from the captain that doesn't mean I actually have a man I want to put it on and even if I do end up looking for another team member there's no guarantee that that Pokemon will actually be able to learn cut initially I really wanted a shiny Diglett but because of Arena trap I realized that this just was not possible at first I didn't mind that they had Arena trap I just planned on koing every single Diglett that I saw but it was giving me way too much exp and I was pretty sure I was going to reach level 100 before I actually found a shiny diglet I may have not found a shiny Diglett but what I did find was absolutely crazy I found a message from today's sponsor by if you've ever used American sides to buy anything from Japan you've probably noticed a huge price spike this is where baay could come in and save you a lot of money baay is a service that places ERS or bids on your behalf on Japanese shopping and auction sites and ships them straight to you

description below and get 10% off your first time order from buy again that is a 10% blanket discount on your first time order from buy go get the coolest things you've always wanted from Japan and of course thank you baay for sponsoring this video eventually I decided to hunt for my next team member on Route 6 which is just North of Vermillion City on Route Six we could either get a Pidgey a Meowth or an Oddish again these are not great options but as long as it could learn cut I really don't care and finally for the first time that I could ever remember I found a shiny below odds assuming I did my math right I got this at almost exactly 8,000 encounters and it ended up being a shiny Oddish at level 15 I looked it up and yes Oddish can learn C after paralyzing Oddish it only took a few pokeballs to catch it and I end up nicknaming it yeah also VI plume is a super good Pokemon so I'm actually pretty happy I caught this now with odish on our team we're able to take on Serge who leads off with a Voltorb at level 21 Voltorb goes down with only two bites as Serge sends out his next Pokemon which is a Pikachu at level 18 who takes a lot of damage from bite sege then goes for a super potion bringing Pikachu back up to full HP but a couple more bites and it ends up going down last out his Raichu so I send out Charmeleon and go for Ember and he ends up going for double team which is extremely cringe but luckily my less cringe strategy of going for Ember is enough to take it down and for the first time I finally have an easy gemm battle and now that we have the Thunder badge it is it's time to take on my favorite part of the entire game Rock Tunnel all jokes aside this was extremely easy to get through and by the way odish evolved in the Gloom so that's cool after getting out of Rock Tunnel I head straight through Lavender Town all the way to sadon City Charmeleon now knows flamethrower so I decided to head straight to Erica because I'm pretty sure with that move I'm able to sweep through her entire team victory bill goes down with only one flamethrower and so does tangla and last up is vume at level 29 who also goes down to one flamethrower so yeah flamethrower was enough now that we got the rainbow badge it's time to take on the rocket hideout in the game Corner the very first grun I end up taking out is enough to get Charmeleon up to level 36 where he evolves into everybody's favorite shiny charizard I know everybody says this is their favorite shiny but it's for a good reason because this thing looks absolutely amazing the gani fight went about as well as you could imagine the only issue I had is with this Kangaskhan but eventually I was able to take it down with snake gvani then drops the sil scope and we're able to head to Pokemon Tower the Rival Battle ends up going super well mainly just because I put this off until I couldn't anymore I beat up a ghost Marowak and then rescue Fuji as he says thank you very much and gives us a poke flute so we could actually continue on our journey but first I think it's time to find another team member in Saffron City there is a fighting dojo and if you be every single person inside of the fighting Dojo you get an option between a hitmon Lee and a hitmon Chan I've never even attempted to hunt for either of these before so I decided this time I'm going to go for it I ended up hunting for a Hitmonchan instead of hitmon Lee mainly just because of the coverage moves that Hitmonchan could learn I definitely did not forget about the Gen 3 Split stuff this one took a very very long time I don't know why but it took upwards of 2 months looking for this shiny on and off obviously I wasn't hunting 24 hours a day for the shiny but it's still ridiculous that it took this long and after roughly 30,000 resets I finally get my shiny Hitmonchan in boxing you have the Red Corner and the blue corner so I wonder if that's why hitmon Chan's gloves are blue maybe maybe not I don't know I still think he's pretty cool if you guys are enjoying this video and it's not too much effort I would really appreciate it if you did subscribe and if not it's complet Ely fine just let me know how I can improve down in the comments below so maybe I could get you next time now of course I would be dumb if I did not take advantage of a very strong static Pokémon so of course I had to do the thing that makes sense to everybody I killed Snorlax and now I'm going to head to KOCO gym on the way I decided to give Gloom a leaf stone that way it evolves into VI Bloom I decided to do this now just because yeah I actually learned Moonlight which is exactly what I was waiting for eventually I make it the coughing and he leads off with a Koga at level 37 I lead off with vop plume and put coughing to sleep and then just bam cut and it takes a very long time but eventually coughing does end up going down next out is Muk and we all know koga's Muk loves to go for minimiz so as soon as I put this thing to sleep I switch out on the Charizard I decided to spam flamethrower here and unfortunately Muk does set up a lot of minimizes but somehow I end up getting lucky and I end up taking it down anyway coffin gets one shot with a flamethrower and last out is wheezing at level 43 who ends up going down to only a couple of flamethrowers even though it did out levels us which is kind of wild now it's time to go back up to saffron and take on silco now that we got a few more levels once we at silco of course our rival is there and I would be pretty concerned if he wasn't yah is a great counter to a starter and is able to do a lot of damage to execute before I end up getting parap used so I just end up switching out to Hitmonchan who takes it out with only a couple of ice punches next out is Alex Zam and normally you would switch here 100% of the time but for some reason Hitmonchan just decided to get a critical hit and take him out so that was pretty cool Hitmonchan then tries to take down the growth but unfortunately he's just shy being able to take down the growth as it goes down with only a sliver of HP left so I switch in Charizard to finish the job and that is our rival once again out of the way and now it's time to hunt for our next team member which of course is going to be Lapras I know I got this in the last video but I'm getting it again because it has access to Surf strength and Ice Beam which is super helpful so like always for these static encounters I put everybody except one Pokemon in the box and it is time once again ter Resa like I have no life I was absolutely on the grind to get this shiny Lapras to beat this game you need a Pokemon that knows strength and surf so this is not optional and Lapras feels both of those roles so I don't really know if there's any alternatives and also I just like Lapras a lot so I think it's a good fit luckily this one did not take 2 months to do this one took around 15,000 resets which of course is above odds but at this point since this is like my sixth or seventh shiny only video I'm definitely used to it purple lais is also objectively better than normal AIS welcome to the team buddy the Giovani fight was so easy it's not even worth talking about but if you really want to watch it here it is in 30 times speed viop plume is pretty much just a hard counter to Giovani at this point and the only issue I had was with nid Queen I just had to switch out for this one unfortunately but I do end up winning I then get to talk to the president and he gives me a masterball which I Will Not Waste on a Pidgey now I head all the way back to fuchsia City and grab the gold teeth the TM for double team as well as the HM for surf I then go give this old guy his teeth back as he gives me the hm for strength and then I push this rock around to get a rare candy which I have been stockpiling this entire time now I got to go back up to saffron to take on Sabrina but before I go to seladon and get the TM for Ice Beam for Lapras now I can go back to saffron to take on Sabrina I think so this battle actually ended up being really good she leads off with a Kadabra at level 38 and I lead off with Lapras just to try to do as much damage as possible and actually ends up koing the Kadabra and doing some good damage to Mr mime Mr mime then goes for a barrier and then a baton pass into venomoth which is just so wild to me so I just decided to switch out on the Charizard here because I know Charizard could easily take this thing out and I don't have to worry about it getting healed up and it's also able to take down the Mr mime as well leaving her to her last Pokemon alexam which just destroys my Charizard I send out snake just to try to do some damage to this thing and I do end up getting a bite off before going down and I decide to send out hit mchan next which actually surprisingly does some pretty good damage but unfortunately Alakazam does get healed up hit monan then goes down to a sidekick so I send out yeah and I end up going for Sleep powder here after taking a sidekick which does a lot of damage and almost koos me leaving me with only 4 HP luckily sleep powder does connect so I do have at least a turn figure something out I go for pedal dance knowing it's probably not enough for AKO as Alakazam gets woken up by a full heel but luckily for me petal dance is actually a critical hit and it takes down Alakazam I guess that went as well as it could considering the circumstances next up is a Blain and I was not teaching fight to Charizard so for the first time ever in my entire life I decided to go to cinear Island without using fly normally you just fly to pallet and then you surf down or you could torture yourself by going through this ice cave that you haven't been in since you were like 6 years old because you wanted to find Articuno wait I mean I guess I could should I maybe it took me a ludicrous amount of hours to figure out where to actually go to get through this place without using fly and I'm never going to do it again anyway the blame battle was no big deal it was slightly annoying because Arcanine actually managed to take down Lapras and Rapidash also gave Lapras a lot of trouble because bla just knows how to use full heels and restores and just everything he could possibly imagine I had to send out my own Charizard to take down the Arcanine and it looks like that is the seventh gym badge down only one more to go and then it is time for the Eliot 4 the last gym leader of course is Giani and I decid to lead off with hit munch on just to take down a few just to switch it up a little bit instead of using Lapras for these last two like I always do rorn and Doug Trio both go down the Hitmonchan but unfortunately n Queen is just too much for hitmon train the handle so I switch out into the Lapras and then from there it is absolutely a Clean Sweep with a surf now that we have all eight gym badges out of the way we cannot take on the Elite 4 yet without finding our sixth and final team member I was thinking what what can I catch that's actually strong that I could actually use in the Elite 4 without absolutely breaking the game wide open like Articuno for example after thinking about it I narrowed it down to either Eevee or Snorlax maybe I still had to take on my rival before getting to the Elite 4 so I decided to go ahead and do that yeah is still a hard counter the blast toys so hopefully during the champion fight nothing changes and he doesn't learn like blizzard you would think I would know by now but I honestly have no idea also I decided on Snorlax just because it's a really good mod that I could catch and I don't have to go through a whole bunch of dialogue or dumb animations or can get the nickname every single time the only better solution I guess TimeWise would be to find a wild one but it might suck so I'm good SX is definitely a lot more convenient like I said there's no silly animation or nicknaming thing all you have to do is press a and press the reset button over and over again until you get the result that you want this one actually was not bad at all it was around 9,000 resets overall before I finally got my Shiny Snorlax and I didn't even have an issue catching them because I have a master ball and with that that is our sixth and final team member welcome back back lazy I can now finally head to the Elite 4 Victory Road like always is a piece of cake because you actually don't have to fight anybody for victory road which is kind of um odd regardless now that we're out we're able to train up our team and take on the Elite 4 for the final time only using shinies this is going to be the final team and move sets going into the Elite 4 I worked with what I had and honestly it could have ended up a lot worse I tried to give Arbok like really good moves but the only useful thing I probably put on him is toxic um but yeah I tried anyway without any further Ado let's get into it first up of course is lorai who sends out a dong at level 52 and I decided to lead off with yaah because I thought it was a good idea but I got crit by as beam and ya ends up going down almost immediately I send out hit muncha next and go for Big Break which is enough to take down the dong and next up is the slow bro at level 52 and I really didn't know who to switch out into here so I decided eventually on snake I end up going for everybody's favorite move toxic as I get put to sleep because of yan unfort fortunately after a couple of surf snake ends up going down so I decid to send out lazy I go for headbutt here and luckily it is enough to take it out and Cloister is next up at level 51 I end up going for yawn as cler ends up setting up spikes so I switch out into Hitmonchan once cler falls asleep and then I just end up spamming brick break because lorai loves to use for restores next out is jinx who takes down Hitmonchan with an ice punch so I send out Charizard and go for a flamethrower which absolutely destroys it and last up is Lapras and all it took to beat Lapras was a little bit of luck and flamethrower and now with lur light out of the way next up is everybody's favorite Elite 4 member and the strongest member by the way Bruno first out from Bruno is an onyx at level 51 who gets decimated by pedal dance and next up is the hitmon Chan at level 53 not as cool as mine because mine has blue gloves but he is able to confuse ya and take him down I send out Charizard next and I honestly think I'm going to decimate this thing with wing attack but ends up hanging on with literally one HP and hits me with a rockt which lowers my speed and does half my health at this point I think machamp's going to eat me alive so I switch out on the snake here and I get hit with a critical hit right away and I decide to go for a screech to lower mitcham's defense so maybe I could end up doing some damage with Hitmonchan brick break ends up getting a critical hit here but Machamp does take me down with a cross drop so I send out Charizard again knowing this thing's wait it didn't get healed up what after Bruno lets his Ace die he sends out hitmon L and takes down Charizard with a mega kick which is the first time in a long time that Charizard actually went down so I to send out Lapras to finish up the rest of the battle and that is Bruno out of the way next up is Agatha Agatha leads off with her most annoying Gengar at level 54 and ends up going for double team of course and unfortunately Lapras isn't able to do just over half h with surf so Gengar ends up getting healed up and then it goes for toxic and it's just not looking great for me but it gets greedy and goes for more double teams so it's able to get taken out with only a surf gobat then takes down Lapras with air cutter so I switch out into lazy I thought lazy would be able to take down goldbat but I get confused and lazy ends up hitting itself in confusion a lot so I have the switch out in the Charizard goldbat goes down to a flamethrower and next up is Arbok at level 56 who us be with a screech before going down to a couple of flamethrowers next out is Gengar who does a lot of damage with sludge bomb but it does get taken down with only a couple of flamethrowers and the same thing happens to Hunter Charizard definitely came in clutch there but I'm not so sure he could do that with Lance Lance leads off with a Gyarados at level 56 and I lead off with Hitmonchan and go for a Thunder Punch just to try to do a little bit of damage of Gyarados that didn't do any damage because of the Gen 3 special physical split stuff so I am able to switch out into lazy relatively safe and I'm able to set up a roll out which eventually is able to take down the Gyarados and it's able to one shot the Aerodactyl I'm pretty sure if I was able to move first there I would be able to oneshot the Dragonite Dragonite moves first and takes down lazy and then it's able to one shot snake with a hyperbeam but not before I get a toxic gol and lais comes in to clean it up with an ice beam also cleans up dragon air with an ice beam and he also cleans up dragon a with an ice beam and with that Lance is taken care of and the only battle left in the entire game is with our rival here we go initially the plan was to lead off with Snorlax and Snorlax take down Pidgeot with a roll out but this did not go to plan at all I end up only connecting with one roll out and then I get hit with a sand attack and I missed literally everything else except one crit which gets completely healed off with a full restore so I just decided to go for rest here healing up and my stats are absolutely a mess after that feather dance so I end up switching out the snake Pidgeot unfortunately just destroys snake here so I just end up sending out a lap hit this thing with an ice beam and it is enough to take it out for some reason his next mon is Rydon who just gets one shot with surf so that was a little bit odd next out is Executor which is also again a little bit odd because it goes down with only two ice beams and next out is Alakazam at level 57 and Lapras finally has met her match as she eventually ends up going down to a sidekick by Alakazam as soon as the reflect wears off go for headbutt and it's enough to take down Alakazam but next up is Arcanine at level 59 so I decided to set up a roll out which actually turned out really well even though Arcanine gets healed up with a full restore another roll out brings it right back down in the red so what's forced to go for Extreme Speed to take me out I send out Charizard to finish off the Arcanine and last up is blast toys and I just decided to go for a flamethrower here knowing unfortunately blast toys will take down Charizard with one hydrop pump but with that I'm able to get a safe switch into to yeah where I'm able to put blast toys asleep and use pedal dance to take down blast toys beating the game with only shinies if this video somehow gets me to 70,000 subscribers I will do this again in any game that you guys choose but until then that's it bye-bye\""

       "'In Generation 3 the odds of encountering a shiny Pokémon are 1 in 8,192 in the new generations of Pokémon you have access to something called a shiny charm which increases the odds. I need to have a full team of six shiny Pokémon before entering the Elite 4 every Pokemon must be shiny. Charmander is going to be a lot worse at early game compared to Squirtle and Bulbasaur resetting for Charmander was a very annoying task. After many many hours and almost 177,000 resets I end up getting my shiny charmander Charmander does look pretty cool but we all know its final evolution looks a lot cooler. Charmander evolved into Charmeleon which follows the same exact color scheme as Charmander did after defeating a super nerd in Mal Moon. I have to pick a fossil and I end up choosing the Helix Fossil. It has also occurred to me that I\\'m not going to beat Misty with a charmeleon. Using this method I\\'m able to encounter more Pokémon per hour compared to resetting for my starter. This is mainly because there\\'s no dialogue to get through and it doesn\\'t ask me to name my starter every 2 seconds. For my next team member I end up going west of Cillian this is Route four. This battle specifically highlights how broken a parap Flinch combo was in Generation 3. I end up using glare on Staryu and taking it out with a critical bite. Last up is the star me where I barely survive an attack with only 3 HP paralyze star me and then just Spam by. \"I really wanted a shiny Diglett but because of Arena trap I realized that this just was not possible at first\" \"I just planned on koing every single Diglett that I saw but it was giving me way too much exp and I was pretty sure I was going to reach level 100 before I actually found a shiny diglet\" \"Even though I get the HM cut from the captain that doesn\\'t mean I actually have a man I want to put it on\"  baay is a service that places ERS or bids on your behalf on Japanese shopping and auction sites and ships them straight to you. B is super easy to use and has support for multiple languages and ships worldwide. Check out my link in the description below and get 10% off your first time order from buy again. \"I decided to hunt for my next team member on Route 6 which is just North of Vermillion City on Route Six we could either get a Pidgey a Meowth or an Oddish again these are not great options but as long as it could learn cut I really don\\'t care\" \"For the first time that I could ever remember I found a shiny below odds assuming I did my math right I got this at almost exactly 8,000 encounters and it ended up being a shiny Oddish at level 15\" Charmeleon now knows flamethrower so I decided to head straight to Erica because I\\'m pretty sure with that move I\\'m able to sweep through her entire team victory bill. Charmeleon and go for Ember and he ends up going for double team which is extremely cringe but luckily my less cringe strategy of going for Ember is enough to take it down. Charmeleon goes up to level 36 where he evolves into everybody\\'s favorite shiny charizard. The Rival Battle ends up going super well mainly just because I put this off until I couldn\\'t anymore. This one took a very very long time I don\\'t know why but it took upwards of 2 months looking for this shiny. After roughly 30,000 resets I finally get my shiny Hitmonchan in boxing. Elyse\\'s first gym battle. She takes on a Koga at level 37. Elyse uses a leaf stone to evolve Gloom into VI Bloom. She also uses flamethrower on Muk. Hitmonchan is a great counter to a starter and is able to do a lot of damage to execute before I end up getting parap used so I just end up switching out to Hitmonchan who takes it out with only a couple of ice punches next out is Alex Zam and normally you would switch here 100% of the time but for some reason hitmonchan just decided to get a critical hit and take him out so that was pretty cool. coffin gets one shot with a flamethrower and last out is wheezing at level 43 who ends up going down to only a few flamETHrowers even though it Lapras has access to Surf strength and Ice Beam which is super helpful. This one took around 15,000 resets which of course is above odds. purple lais is also ob. er of HP left so I switch in Charizard to finish the job. Viop plume is pretty much just a hard counter to Giovani at this point and the only issue I had was with nid Queen I just had to switch out for this one unfortunately but I do end up winning. I then get to talk to the president and he gives me a masterball which I Will Not Waste on a Pidgey now I head all the way back to fuchsia City and grab the gold teeth the TM for double team as well as the HM for surf. She leads off with a Kadabra at level 38 and I lead off with Lapras just to try to do as much damage as possible. I end up going for Sleep powder here after taking a sidekick which does a lot of damage and almost koos m. Alakazam gets woken up by a full heel but luckily for me petal dance is actually a critical hit and it takes down Alakzam. I was not teaching fight to Charizard so for the first time ever in my entire life I decided to go to cinear Island without using fly normally you just fly to pallet and then you surf down or you could torture yourself by going through this ice cave that you haven\\'t been in since you were like 6 years old because you wanted to find Articuno. Giani is the last gym leader of course is Giani and I decid to lead off with hit munch on just to take down a few just to switch it up a little bit instead of using Lapras for these last two like I always do rorn and Doug Trio both go down the Hitmonchan but unfortunately n Queen is just too much for hitmon train the handle so I switch out into the Lapras and then from there it is absolutely a Clean Sweep with a surf. SX is definitely a lot more convenient like I said there\\'s no silly animation or nicknaming thing all you have to do is press a and press the reset button over and over again until you get the result that you want this one actually was n. se in the Elite 4. This is the final team and move sets going into the Elite 4. Arbok is our sixth and final team member welcome back back lazy. Victory Road is a piece of cake because you actually don\\'t have to fight anybody for victory road. Next up is the slow bro at level 52 and I really didn\\'t know who to switch out into here so I decided eventually on snake. by as beam and ya ends up going down almost immediately I send out hit muncha next and go for Big Break which is enough to take down the dong. Last up is Lapras and all it took to beat Lapras was a little bit of luck and flamethrower and now with lur l l. Bruno first out from Bruno is an onyx at level 51 who gets decimated by pedal dance. Next up is the hitmon Chan at level 53 not as cool as mine because mine has blue gloves but he is able to confuse ya and take him down. I send out Charizard next and I honestly think I\\'m going to decimate this thing with wing attack but ends up hanging on with literally one HP. Next up is Agatha Agatha leads off with her most annoying Gengar at level 54 and ends up going for double team of course. Lapras isn\\'t able to do just over half h with surf so Lapras ends up getting healed up and then it goes for toxic and it\\'s just not looking great for me. Gengar does a lot of damage with sludge bomb but it does get taken down with only a couple of flamethrowers. Lance leads off with a Gyarados at level 56 and I lead off with Hitmonchan. Snorlax takes down Pidgeot with a roll out. Rydon gets one shot with surf so that was a little bit odd. Executor goes down with only two ice beams. Alakazam at level 57 and Lapras finally has met. \"If this video somehow gets me to 70,000 subscribers I will do this again in any game that you guys choose\" \"Until then that\\'s it bye-bye\" \"I\\'m able to put blast toys asleep and use pedal dance to take down blast toys\"'"
